Binance Crypto Data Analysis Repository
Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks designed for fetching, processing, and analyzing cryptocurrency market data from Binance. The notebooks are tailored for traders, data analysts, or developers interested in cryptocurrency market analysis, offering tools to retrieve futures data, market capitalization, and historical candlestick data.

Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb: Fetches and processes data on cryptocurrency futures available on Binance, retrieving their market capitalization using the CoinGecko API, and exports the results to an Excel file.
B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb: Retrieves 1-minute historical candlestick (kline) data for a user-specified cryptocurrency trading pair and BTCUSDT from the Binance API, saving the data to an Excel file.

Repository Structure:
Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb: Notebook for fetching futures data and market capitalization.
B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb: Notebook for fetching 1-minute kline data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
output/: Directory for output files (e.g., Excel files generated by the notebooks; created automatically).

Prerequisites:
Python Version: Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
requests (for API calls in Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb)
pandas (for data manipulation in both notebooks)
python-binance (for Binance API interaction in B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb)
xlsxwriter (for Excel output in B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb)


Binance API Credentials: Required for B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb. Obtain an API key and secret from Binance.
Internet Connection: Required to access Binance and CoinGecko APIs.

Setup:
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

Install Dependencies:Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install requests pandas python-binance xlsxwriter

Configure Binance API Credentials (for B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb):

Open B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb.
Replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_api_secret' with your Binance API key and secret in the notebook.

Usage
1. Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb
Description:This Jupyter Notebook (Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb) fetches and processes data on cryptocurrency futures available on Binance, retrieving their market capitalization using the CoinGecko API. The script performs the following tasks:

Fetches Binance Futures Data: Uses the Binance Futures API (https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo) to retrieve a list of futures trading pairs.
Retrieves Market Capitalization: Queries the CoinGecko API to obtain market cap data for the coins corresponding to the Binance futures symbols.
Exports to Excel: Combines the futures data with market cap information and saves it to an Excel file (binance_futures_coins_with_market_cap.xlsx) for further analysis.

The notebook uses Python libraries (requests and pandas) to handle API requests and data manipulation. It includes error handling for API calls and is designed to map Binance futures symbols to CoinGecko coin IDs.
This script is useful for traders, analysts, or developers interested in analyzing Binance futures markets and their associated market cap data.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: requests, pandas

Output:
An Excel file (binance_futures_coins_with_market_cap.xlsx) containing futures symbols, their segment (futures), and market capitalization in USD.

Steps:
Open the notebook in Jupyter:jupyter notebook Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb
Run all cells to fetch data, process it, and generate the Excel file.

Note:
Ensure an active internet connection to fetch data from the Binance and CoinGecko APIs.

2. B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb
Description:This Jupyter Notebook (B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb) retrieves 1-minute historical candlestick (kline) data for a user-specified cryptocurrency trading pair (e.g., ADAUSDT) and BTCUSDT from the Binance API. The script is designed to collect and process market data, storing it in an Excel file for further analysis. Key functionalities include:

User Input for Coin Symbol: Prompts the user to input a coin symbol (e.g., BNB, ADA) to fetch data for the corresponding USDT trading pair.
Binance API Integration: Uses the python-binance library to fetch up to 1,000 1-minute kline data points for both BTCUSDT and the specified coin's USDT pair.
Data Processing: Converts the fetched data into Pandas DataFrames, formats timestamps, and ensures numeric columns are properly typed.
Excel Output: Saves the processed data into an Excel file with two sheets—one for BTCUSDT and one for the user-specified coin—in a designated directory (D:\Projects\Binance\Crypto Data).

Note:
TheNotebook currently encounters a ValueError due to a mismatch between the expected 11 columns and the 12 columns returned by the Binance API. This issue stems from an additional 'Ignore' column in the kline data, which needs to be accounted for in the column definitions.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, python-binance, xlsxwriter
Binance API key and secret (to be updated in the script)

Output:
An Excel file (e.g., ADA_BTCUSDT_1Mint_500000.xlsx) containing 1-minute kline data for BTCUSDT and the specified coin.

Fix Needed:
Update the columns list to include the 12th 'Ignore' column:columns = ['Open Time', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', 'Close Time', 
           'Quote Asset Volume', 'Number of Trades', 'TB Base Volume', 'TB Quote Volume', 'Ignore']



Steps:
Open the notebook in Jupyter:jupyter notebook B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb
Apply the column fix mentioned above.
Run all cells.
Enter a coin symbol (e.g., ADA, BNB) when prompted.

Usage Notes:
Install required libraries: pip install pandas python-binance xlsxwriter
Update apikey and secret with your Binance API credentials.
Fix the column mismatch issue as noted above.
Ensure an active internet connection and valid Binance API credentials for data retrieval.

Notes:
API Limits: Adhere to Binance and CoinGecko API rate limits to prevent request failures.
Directory Configuration: For B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb, ensure the output directory (D:\Projects\Binance\Crypto Data) exists or modify the output_path variable to a valid directory.
Error Handling: Both notebooks include basic error handling, but stable internet connectivity is essential.
Security: Keep Binance API credentials secure and avoid committing them to version control.
Bug Fix: The column mismatch in B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb must be resolved before successful execution.
