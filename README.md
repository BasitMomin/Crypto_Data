Binance Crypto Data Analysis Repository
Overview
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks designed for fetching, processing, and analyzing cryptocurrency market data from Binance. The notebooks are intended for traders, data analysts, or developers interested in cryptocurrency market analysis.

Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb: Fetches Binance futures trading pairs and their corresponding market capitalization using the Binance Futures API and CoinGecko API, exporting the results to an Excel file.
B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb: Retrieves 1-minute historical candlestick (kline) data for a user-specified coin's USDT trading pair and BTCUSDT, saving the data to an Excel file.

Repository Structure

Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb: Notebook for fetching futures data and market cap.
B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb: Notebook for fetching 1-minute kline data.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
output/: Directory for output files (e.g., Excel files generated by the notebooks; created automatically).

Prerequisites

Python Version: Python 3.x
Required Libraries:
requests (for API calls in Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb)
pandas (for data manipulation in both notebooks)
python-binance (for Binance API interaction in B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb)
xlsxwriter (for Excel output in B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb)


Binance API Credentials: Required for B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb. Obtain an API key and secret from Binance.
Internet Connection: Required to access Binance and CoinGecko APIs.

Setup
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>


Install Dependencies:Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install requests pandas python-binance xlsxwriter


Configure Binance API Credentials (for B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb):
Open B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb.
Replace 'your_api_key' and 'your_api_secret' with your Binance API key and secret in the notebook.



Usage
1. Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb
Purpose: Fetches Binance futures trading pairs and their market capitalization, exporting the data to an Excel file.

Steps:
Open the notebook in Jupyter:jupyter notebook Binance_future_coin_list.ipynb


Run all cells to:
Fetch futures data from the Binance Futures API (https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/exchangeInfo).
Retrieve market cap data from the CoinGecko API.
Save the results to binance_futures_coins_with_market_cap.xlsx in the working directory.



Output:
An Excel file (binance_futures_coins_with_market_cap.xlsx) containing columns for futures symbols, segment (futures), and market capitalization in USD.

2. B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb
Purpose: Fetches 1-minute historical kline data for a user-specified coin's USDT trading pair and BTCUSDT, saving the data to an Excel file.
Important Note: The notebook currently has a bug causing a ValueError due to a mismatch in the number of columns (11 expected, 12 received). To fix this:

Update the columns list in the notebook to include the 'Ignore' column:columns = ['Open Time', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume', 'Close Time', 
           'Quote Asset Volume', 'Number of Trades', 'TB Base Volume', 'TB Quote Volume', 'Ignore']



Steps:
Open the notebook in Jupyter:jupyter notebook B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb

Apply the column fix mentioned above.
Run all cells.
Enter a coin symbol (e.g., ADA, BNB) when prompted.
The notebook will:
Fetch up to 1,000 1-minute kline data points for BTCUSDT and the specified coin's USDT pair.
Process the data into Pandas DataFrames with formatted timestamps and numeric columns.
Save the data to an Excel file (e.g., ADA_BTCUSDT_1Mint_500000.xlsx) in D:\Projects\Binance\Crypto Data.



Output:
An Excel file with two sheets:
BTCUSDT: Kline data for BTCUSDT.
<coin_symbol>: Kline data for the specified coin's USDT pair.

Notes:
API Limits: Ensure compliance with Binance and CoinGecko API rate limits to avoid request failures.
Directory Configuration: For B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb, ensure the output directory (D:\Projects\Binance\Crypto Data) exists or modify the output_path variable to a valid directory on your system.
Error Handling: Both notebooks include basic error handling for API requests, but ensure stable internet connectivity.
Fixing B-Crypto_5L_Data.ipynb: The column mismatch issue must be resolved before running the notebook successfully.
Security: Keep your Binance API key and secret secure. Do not share them publicly or commit them to version control.
